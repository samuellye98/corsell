# Corsell Application

An e-commerce mobile-based platform for students. (Work in progress!)

### Expo

We are using the Expo, a free and open source toolchain built around React Native to build the app.
Download the Expo app from the Apple/Play store.

After `expo start`, scan the QR code generated using the mobile application to preview the application.

### Mac OS

npm install
expo start

For Windows you need to set up the toolchain for node-gyp before installing this repository, follow the instructions in https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp#on-windows.
